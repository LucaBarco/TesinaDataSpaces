## Abstract
The cardiovascular diseases are one of the most frequent causes of death.  They mainly causes heart failures: the hearthcannot pump enough blood to satisfy the needs of the body.  Nowadays, the electronic medical records can help in findingcorrelations between symptoms and body values, and applying machine learning algorithms can help to predict the patientâ€™ssurvival and to highlight the most important features to take in consideration.This work aims to train classifiers in order to predict the death of a patient with an heart failure.  It is based on the datasetused in the work of Chicco and Jurman  [1] "Machine learning can predict survival of patients with heart failure from serumcreatinine and ejection fraction alone".
