## Abstract
The cardiovascular diseases are one of the most frequent causes of death. They mainly causes heart failures: the hearth
cannot pump enough blood to satisfy the needs of the body. Nowadays, the electronic medical records can help in finding
correlations between symptoms and body values, and applying machine learning algorithms can help to predict the patientâ€™s
survival and to highlight the most important features to take in consideration.
This tesina is based on the dataset used in the work of Chicco and Jurman [1] "Machine learning can predict survival of
patients with heart failure from serum creatinine and ejection fraction alone".
